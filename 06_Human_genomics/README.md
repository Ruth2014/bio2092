# Human mitochondrial variation and Mitomap/Mitomaster
During the lectures and in your outside reading, you will have come across human mitochondrial halpogroups. 

The major mitochondrial haplogroups are named with letters (A, B, C ...) and their relationships with each other can be represtented by a phylogenetic tree:

You will recall that mtDNA is inherited through the maternal line, it is haploid, and is not subject to recombination. That is why its evolution can be represented by a tree. 
The various mtDNA haplogroups are associated with geographical locations. Therefore, it is an excellent marker for tracing human migrations:

In this excercise, we are going to use the [Mitomap](https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/WebHome) and
[Mitomaster](https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMASTER/WebHome) to explore and analyse human mtDNA sequences.

## What complete mitochondrial genomes are available in the public databases?
First, let's query the GenBank database for all complete or nearly-complete human mtDNA sequences.
First, navigate your browser to https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/Mitobank. 
You can also read this via the `Mitobank` link on the Mitomap front page (https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/WebHome).

Here, you should see a page something like this:

Now click on `To search for complete or near-complete sequences, click: Execute Search` and you 

Question                                                                                   | Answer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------
How many complete (or nearly complete) human mitochondrial genome sequences are available? |

## The mitochondrial genetic code
Now, take a look at the mitochondrial genetic code here: https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/HumanMitoCode.
Uou can also reach this via a link on the front page (https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/WebHome).
Can you find any differences between the mitochondrial genetic code and the standard genetic code?

Codon | Standard genetic code | Mitochcondrial genetic code
----- | --------------------- | ---------------------------
TGA   |                       |
___   |                       | 
AGA   |                       | Stop 
___   | Isoleucine            | Methionine

## Analysing a mitochondrial genome sequence using Mitomap
We are going to analyse the mitochondrial genome of an individual. The sequence data can be found here:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/eu915478.

Download this genome sequence as a FastA-formatted file (`Using the Send to file` link):

![Download page](media/download.png)

This will result in a file called `sequence.fasta` being downloaded into your `Downloads` folder.
We are going to perform analyses on this downloaded file.

Navigate your web browser to https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMASTER/WebHome.

For now, we are going to skip Step 1. Please proceed to `Step 2, Option 1` and upload the `sequence.fasta` file that you downloaded.
