# Human mitochondrial variation and Mitomap/Mitomaster
During the lectures and in your outside reading, you will have come across human mitochondrial halpogroups. You will recall that
mtDNA is inherited through the maternal line, it is haploid, and is not subject to recombination. Therefore, it is an excellent
marker of relationships among individuals and populations and is used to trace mutation patterns.

The major mitochondrial haplogroups are named with letters (A, B, C ...) and their relationships with each other can be represtented by a phylogenetic tree:
