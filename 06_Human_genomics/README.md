During the lectures and in your outside reading, you will have come across human mitochondrial halpogroups. 

The major mitochondrial haplogroups are named with letters (A, B, C ...) and their relationships with each other can be represtented by a phylogenetic tree:

You will recall that mtDNA is inherited through the maternal line, it is haploid, and is not subject to recombination. That is why its evolution can be represented by a tree. 
The various mtDNA haplogroups are associated with geographical locations. Therefore, it is an excellent marker for tracing human migrations:

In this excercise, we are going to use the [Mitomap](https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/WebHome) and
[Mitomaster](https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMASTER/WebHome) to explore and analyse human mtDNA sequences.

## What complete mitochondrial genomes are available in the public databases?
First, let's query the GenBank database for all complete or nearly-complete human mtDNA sequences.
First, navigate your browser to https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/Mitobank.

Here, you should see a page something like this:

Now click on `To search for complete or near-complete sequences, click: Execute Search` and you 

Question                                                                                   | Answer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------
How many complete (or nearly complete) human mitochondrial genome sequences are available? |

## The mitochondrial genetic code
Now, take a look at the mitochondrial genetic code here: https://www.mitomap.org/foswiki/bin/view/MITOMAP/HumanMitoCode.
Can you find any differences between the mitochondrial genetic code and the standard genetic code?
