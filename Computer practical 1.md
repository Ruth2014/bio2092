# BIO2092 Computer practical 1
## Accessing genomic sequence data on the WWW

### Introduction
During the first few lectures on this course, you have heard a lot about so-called “next-generation” sequencing (NGS)
methods such as Illumina. These methods have been available since around 2006 and in the last decade or so have hugely
expanded the limits of what is achievable in all kinds of fields of biological and biomedical research. You have also
heard about the Sanger method, which has been available since the 1970s.
In this practical session, you will consolidate your understanding of the data generated by these methods and some
of the approaches to analysing such data. We will continue to discuss this in the next lectures.


### Laboratory simulation of NGS

* If you have not done so already, please work through this Labster simulation. This will take approximately 35 minutes.

* It is based on a real published research study involving the sequencing of ancient DNA from remains of a man who lived about 4000 years ago (Rasmussen et al., 2010).

* You can access this simulation via the link on the Labster section of the BIO2092 ELE page: http://vle.exeter.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4041#section-7
